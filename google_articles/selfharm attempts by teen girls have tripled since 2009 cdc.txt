Self-harm attempts by teen girls have tripled since 2009, says a new study from the Centers for Disease Control.

The study looked at 43,138 first-time, non-fatal emergency room visits for self-harm cases (self-inflicted hard from overdose/poisoning, cutting and blunt objects) in young people age 10 to 24 from 2001 to 2015.

From 1993 to 2008, rates for self-harm emergency room visits ranged from 1.1 to 9.6 per 1,000. But between 2001 and 2015, the incidence of self-inflicted injury rose from 206.6 per 100,000 to 303.7 per 100,000 in the 14-year period.

A spike in self-harm visits occurred after 2008 — particularly for young girls, whose self-harm rates nearly tripled from 110 per 100,000 in 2008 to 318 per 100,000 in 2015.

Boys’ rates for the whole 14-year span remained stable.

Girls 10 to 14 saw the highest number of emergency room incidents in this same period, with an increase of nearly 19% per year from 2008 to 2014.

The researchers were unsure why self-harm rates increased for girls, in that period, but some experts speculate cyberbullying and economic stress after the 2008 recession.

The study, however, did not distinguish between suicidal and non-suicidal intent. It also only included emergency room visits, so they are presumed to be underreported from all cases of self-injury.

The trend parallels rises in teen depression and suicide rates. The study says self-harm is one of the strongest risk factors for suicide, which is the second leading cause of death among young people aged 10 to 24. This research, the authors say, shows the need for comprehensive suicide and self-harm prevention tactics within health systems.
