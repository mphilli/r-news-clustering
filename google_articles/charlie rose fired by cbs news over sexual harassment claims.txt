Charlie Rose Fired By CBS News Over Sexual Harassment Claims
Dominic Patten
Mere hours after Charlie Rose’s CBS This Morning co-hosts expressed profound disappointment in the sexual harassment allegations against the veteran interviewer, CBS News today fired the host.

“A short time ago we terminated Charlie Rose’s employment with CBS News, effective immediately,” said CBS News boss David Rhodes in a letter to staff Tuesday. “This followed the revelation yesterday of extremely disturbing and intolerable behavior said to have revolved around his PBS program,” the President of the news division added. (see the full letter below)

This end to the 75-year old Rose’s five year run on the early morning show and as a 60 Minutes correspondent followed revelations on Monday of eight women accusing the host of “unwanted sexual advances toward them,” according to the Washington Post. Very soon afterwards CBS, along with PBS and Bloomberg, suspended Rose.

With his long time interview show on ice and his presence on the Big 4 net at that point pending, Rose put out a statement of contrition yesterday. “It is essential that these women know I hear them and that I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior,” he said in part. “I am greatly embarrassed,” Rose added, essentially admitting the accusations were true.

CBS had said on Monday that they would investigate the claims, as they still are with Wisdom of the Crowd actor Jeremy Piven. Obviously, even in this short period, that probe came up incriminating Rose and the net surgically made its decision.
