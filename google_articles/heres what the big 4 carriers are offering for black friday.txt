Black Friday is almost here, and the top four mobile carriers in the US—Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, and Sprint—all have offers lined up. Here are all the details of each carrier's Black Friday sale.

Verizon

This year, Verizon is offering up to 50 percent off the Google Pixel 2, Google Pixel 2 XL, Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, Galaxy Note 8, and Moto Z2 Force when you sign up for Verizon unlimited. That deal does not require a trade in.

The iPhone 8 is notably absent from that list. A Verizon spokesperson confirmed to PCMag that the company is not planning any new iPhone 8 deals for Black Friday. That's a sad departure from last year when Verizon offered the then brand-new iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, plus a number of other hot handsets, for $0 down with an eligible trade-in for Black Friday.

Meanwhile, those who make the switch to Verizon or add up to five new lines on a Verizon device payment plan can get the Asus ZenFone V for free. Verizon is also offering $100 off select Android smartphones with a retail value of $400 or more when you sign up for its unlimited plan. Plus, when you buy a case for your new handset, you can get 50 percent off another case of equal or lesser value.

As for tablets, Verizon will take $250 off the retail price of any iPad when you sign up for two years of service, or $300 off when you also purchase an iPhone with service.

Here's some other Black Friday deals you'll find at Verizon:

AT&T

AT&T doesn't have much when it comes to device deals, but the company is offering some sweet perks when you sign up for its DirecTV Now subscription streaming service.

Prepay for four months of DirecTV Now, and AT&T will give you a free Apple TV 4K. Just keep in mind that DirecTV Now does not support 4K HDR streaming. If you can only prepay for two months, you'll still get a freebie: a Roku Streaming Stick.

Here's some other Black Friday deals you'll find at AT&T:

Up to $50 off Google Home, Amazon Echo, and Nest devices–valid through Monday

$300 off when you buy two UE Megaboom speakers–valid through Dec. 7

Sprint

Sprint will knock 50 percent off your monthly payments when you switch from a different carrier and get a Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+, Galaxy S8 Active, or Moto Z2 Force edition with its Flex lease plan. Plus, when you lease the Moto Z2 Force, Sprint will give you one of two MotoMods for free—either the Insta-Share Projector Moto Mod or the new Alexa Mod.

Meanwhile, if you've been thinking about getting an Essential Phone, Sprint is offering the phone for $25 down and $5 per month on its Flex plan. Starting on Thanksgiving, you can get a free Essential 360 Video Camera (normally $199) when you lease an Essential Phone.

If you need a new tablet, Sprint will give you the LG GPad F2 8.0 for free when you sign up for the carrier's Unlimited tablet data plan for only $20 with autopay.

Here's some other Black Friday deals you'll find at Sprint:

When you buy one of those phones, you'll get another smartphone of equal or lesser value, up to $820, for free after a mail-in rebate.
