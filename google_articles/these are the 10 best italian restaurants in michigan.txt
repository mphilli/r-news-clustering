These are the 10 best Italian restaurants in Michigan
Amy Sherman, Posted November, At Pm, Updated November
On our search for Michigan's Best Italian restaurant, we found that our great state is home to some incredible authentic Italian food, from old school red sauce joints to contemporary trattorias with new takes on traditional favorites.

We, the Michigan’s Best search team of John Gonzalez and Amy Sherman, tasted our way across Michigan, visiting places near and far, mapping out MLive reader recommendations and other great places we heard about. As always, you readers know what you’re talking about, sending us to the best of the best. During our journey, we got to experience everything from white tablecloth places, to red-checked classics, to places that did mostly take out, and even a sweet little sausage shop. We traveled more than 2500 miles, from Marquette to Stevensville, Bay City and Ann Arbor, from Flint to West Michigan, and all over metro Detroit.
