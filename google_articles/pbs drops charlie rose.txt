PBS drops ‘Charlie Rose’
April Simpson
PBS announced Tuesday that it has dropped The Charlie Rose Show, a decision following reports of the longtime talk show host’s harassment of women.

“In light of yesterday’s revelations, PBS has terminated its relationship with Charlie Rose and cancelled distribution of his programs,” PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger said in a statement. “PBS expects all the producers we work with to provide a workplace where people feel safe and are treated with dignity and respect.”

The Washington Post reported accounts by eight women Monday of behavior by Rose that included being nude around them, groping them and making lewd phone calls. A Post reporter said more women have come forward since the story’s publication.
